 * The launch daemon. ShellCore owns the lifecycle of the running title, and
 * libSceLncUtil / libSceSystemService ask "SceLncService" what state it is in.
 *
 * We only ever run one title, in the foreground, for the whole process
 * lifetime, so the answer is constant. It is not zero, though: zero is "no such
 * application", and a library that gates on the title being live then refuses
 * to come up at all.
