 * The NP (PlayStation Network) daemons. libSceNpManager talks to "SceNpMgrIpc"
 * for account/session state and to "SceNpService" for the web-service side.
 *
 * We have no PSN account and no network, so the state to report is a settled
 * signed-out one. That is not the same as replying with zeros: zero is
 * SCE_NP_STATE_UNKNOWN, i.e. "ask again", and a title waiting for NP to settle
 * before it leaves its boot screen will wait forever.
