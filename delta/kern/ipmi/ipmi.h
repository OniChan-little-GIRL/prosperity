/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4 emulation and research project
 *
 * IPMI (Inter-Process Method Invocation) is the RPC the Sony libraries use to
 * reach the system-service processes: ShellCore, LNC, NpManager, PlayGo and so
 * on. We run no service processes, so this subsystem stands in for them: the
 * manager keeps a client table and routes each invoke to a Service that answers
 * as that daemon would.
 *
 * ABI (recovered from libSceIpmi's wrapper -> libkernel stub -> syscall 622):
 *     rdi=op  rsi=kid  rdx=out  r10=in  r8=insize  r9=arg6
 * so the result buffer comes BEFORE the request buffer. The wrapper pre-sets the
 * 32-bit result to -1 and, on a 0 return, reads it back as the call's value
 * (CreateClient's becomes the client kid).
