/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4 emulation and research project
 *
 * The user-account daemon. libSceUserService talks to "SceUserService" for the
 * logged-in user list and the login/logout event queue.
 *
 * There is one local user and it is always signed in, so the state to report is
 * settled: user id kUserId present in the login list, and an event queue that is
 * permanently empty AFTER the initial login has been consumed. Replying with
 * zeros instead would say "user id 0", which is SCE_USER_SERVICE_USER_ID_INVALID
 * -- a title that resolves the foreground user before it builds its HUD then
 * either retries forever or indexes a save slot with an invalid id.
 *
 * Mirrors the HLE libSceUserService shim (runtime/vprx/ps4/libSceUserService),
 * so switching that module between HLE and LLE (DELTA_LLE) reports the same
 * user either way.
