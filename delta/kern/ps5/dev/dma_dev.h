// PS5 /dev/dmem device. The physical-offset bump-allocator ioctls are identical
// to PS4 (both platforms call sceKernelAllocateDirectMemory), so this inherits
// the shared dmaDevice; only the mapping diverges: PS5 backs each mapping with the
// shared physical-dmem memfd (MAP_SHARED) so a CPU-written GPU command buffer and
// the command processor's view of it alias one physOffset. PS4 has no such backing
// (its map falls back to the anonymous path).
