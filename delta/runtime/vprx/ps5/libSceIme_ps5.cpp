/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4/PS5 emulation and research project
 *
 * PS5-only HLE override for sceImeKeyboardOpen. The real .sprx needs the IME
 * service daemon we don't host and fails with 0x80bc0001, which titles don't
 * expect from this call: Minecraft (PPSA17221) asserts on anything but success
 * or 0x80bc0003 / 0x80bc0004, then aborts from its own assert handler.
 *
 * 0x80bc0004 is a status the real sceImeKeyboardOpen returns on its own device
 * paths, and the call site treats it as "no keyboard attached" -- it leaves the
 * keyboard-open flag clear and carries on. Report that rather than faking a
 * keyboard the title would then poll.
 *
 * Everything else in libSceIme stays LLE.
