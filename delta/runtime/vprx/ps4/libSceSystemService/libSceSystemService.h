/*
 * Partial HLE for libSceSystemService: a couple of export overrides. The rest of
 * the module stays LLE (the real .sprx runs; vprx_get returns 0 for the NIDs not
 * listed here, so they resolve to the loaded module).
 *
 * sceSystemServiceReportAbnormalTermination is a crash-telemetry call the title
 * invokes from its own fatal-error path. The real .sprx asserts (int 0x44 -> ud2)
 * when handed a NULL argument, turning a guest-level abort into a hard process
 * crash. It is a no-op for us (no telemetry backend), so report success.
 *
 * sceSystemServiceParamGetInt is how a title reads the console's system
 * settings, the system LANGUAGE above all. There is no console to ask, and the
 * value that means "Japanese" is 0 -- which is also what a title reads when the
 * call fails -- so a title comes up in Japanese unless we answer.
