/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4 emulation and research project
 *
 * The live log panel: the tail of the log drawn over the game, bottom right.
 *
 * A log sink keeps the last few lines in a fixed ring of fixed-length slots, so
 * a title logging thousands of lines a second costs one bounded memcpy per line
 * and nothing per frame. The panel goes straight into the overlay's foreground
 * draw list (one rect plus one AddText per line, clipped rather than measured),
 * so its cost does not depend on how much is being logged.
 *
 * It shows what goes through utl's logger, which is LOG_* plus the base
 * channels routed into it. Most of the emulator's console output is a direct
 * fprintf to stderr and does not pass through here, so the panel is a subset of
 * the terminal, not a mirror of it.
