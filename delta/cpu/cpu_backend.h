/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4 emulation and research project
 *
 * CPU execution backend abstraction.
 *
 * The emulator runs guest PS4 x86-64 code one of two ways depending on the host:
 *
 *  - NativeBackend (x86-64 host, DELTA_BACKEND_NATIVE): guest code runs directly
 *    on the host CPU. The lifter (runtime/code_lift) rewrites guest `syscall`
 *    and `fs:`-relative TLS reads in-place so they trap to host HLE; the guest
 *    entry is just called as a host function and guest threads are host threads.
 *
 *  - FexBackend (aarch64 host, DELTA_BACKEND_FEX): guest code runs inside an
 *    embedded FEXCore JIT. Nothing is rewritten; the JIT decodes `syscall`
 *    itself and hands it to us via a callback (dispatched to lv2), and emulates
 *    fs/gs from the guest CPUState. TLS is the guest fs base in CPUState; each
 *    guest thread is a FEXCore thread pinned to one host thread.
 *
 * Everything else (loader, lv2 HLE, devices) is host-native on both paths.
