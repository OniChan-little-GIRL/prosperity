/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4 emulation and research project
 *
 * The PS4 GPU command processor: consumes the PM4 command buffers the Gnm HLE
 * submits, tracks the Liverpool register state they program, and drives the
 * renderer. This header is its whole surface; the decode itself is split by
 * decision across ps4/ (draw_state, compute_dispatch, shader_cache, cmd_trace),
 * none of which is reachable from outside gpu/.
 *
 * Submission is synchronous: a submit returns once the whole buffer has been
 * walked, so every fence label the packets ask the GPU to write is complete by
 * the time the walk passes it.
