/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4 emulation and research project
 *
 * Which recompiled SPIR-V module a given piece of guest state needs.
 *
 * A guest shader is not its code alone: the translator bakes in register state
 * the code does not carry (which PS inputs are enabled, which sampled images
 * are volumes or integers, the clip convention), so the same bytes under
 * different state are a different module. Everything that decides that lives
 * here, behind two lookups, along with the keying: by code CONTENT rather than
 * address, because titles stream shaders to fresh addresses and an address key
 * then misses forever.
 *
 * Modules are cached for the life of the process. Recompiling costs
 * milliseconds and the working set is bounded by the title's shader count.
