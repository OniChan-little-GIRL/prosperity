/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4 emulation and research project
 *
 * How Liverpool register state becomes one renderer draw.
 *
 * The registers say almost nothing directly: a draw's vertex streams, constant
 * buffers and textures live behind descriptors the shaders load out of their
 * user-data SGPRs, so producing a DrawInfo is as much recovering what the
 * shaders are about to read (gpu/gcn resource tracking) as reading registers.
 * The packet walker only says which draw packet arrived.
