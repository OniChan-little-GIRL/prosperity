/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4 emulation and research project
 *
 * How a compute dispatch's registers and descriptors become one renderer
 * dispatch.
 *
 * A dispatch names nothing directly: the COMPUTE_* registers give a program
 * address and a workgroup shape, and every buffer and image it touches is a
 * descriptor the shader loads out of its user data, possibly through an SRT
 * chain in guest memory another dispatch wrote. Recovering those live ranges,
 * deciding which need staging (a tiled image, a format the GPU cannot alias)
 * and refusing the ones that do not add up happens here.
 *
 * Titles build real content this way: Doom64's level texture atlases, P.T.'s
 * streamed texture uploads. Getting one wrong is a black surface, not a crash,
 * so a refused dispatch is loud (DELTA_GPU_CSDROPS / DELTA_GPU_CSRES).
