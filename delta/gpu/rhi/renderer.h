/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4/PS5 emulation and research project
 *
 * The renderer as the command processors see it. This header and command.h are
 * the whole surface: a command processor decodes guest packets into a DrawInfo
 * or a ComputeInfo and calls the operations below, and never names a graphics
 * API type. The backend lives entirely behind this seam (gpu/vulkan today).
 *
 * The renderer is a value the caller holds: a Renderer with a few cheap
 * queries, operated on by free functions. All backend state hangs off
 * Renderer::state (opaque here; defined by the backend), so a second backend
 * or a test double is a different BackendState behind the same operations.
 *
 * Rendering is offscreen: each draw renders into the image for its
 * DrawInfo::rt_base (a render target keyed by guest address), and EndFrame
 * reads back the target at the scanout address to present it (or dump it,
 * headless).
