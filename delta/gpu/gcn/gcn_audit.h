/*
 * PS4Delta : PS4 emulation and research project
 *
 * Shader translation audit: records, per translated shader, the fate of every
 * instruction (translated / warned-unsupported / silently emitted nothing /
 * unreachable), aggregates the results across the run, and optionally dumps
 * per-shader artifacts. The point is finding unimplemented and
 * silently-wrong translations without staring at warn-once logs:
 *
 *  - DELTA_GPU_SHAUDIT=1|<path>: at exit, print a ranked report of every
 *    unsupported/approximated op (by shaders affected), every silently
 *    dropped instruction, and every declined shader, each with an example
 *    (stage, code hash, pc) to reproduce. With a path, also written there.
 *  - DELTA_GPU_SHDUMP=<dir>: per unique shader, write
 *      <stage>_<hash>.txt  annotated disassembly (per-instruction fate +
 *                          SPIR-V word count -- a non-trivial instruction
 *                          that emitted 0 words is a silent drop),
 *      <stage>_<hash>.gcn  raw bytecode,
 *      <stage>_<hash>.spv  the unoptimized SPIR-V, with OpLine markers
 *                          mapping every SPIR-V op back to its GCN pc
 *                          (spirv-dis shows them as "gcn:<pc>").
 *
 * Single-threaded like the rest of the recompiler (command-processor lock).
 * All hooks are no-ops unless one of the env vars is set.
